# test-template
This repository contains a test scenario template to import or export using any test management

## Why?

Today we have a bunch of test management, but we donâ€™t have any way to easily export an entire test suite created using one test management to another one.

As we have infrastructure as a code (an easy way to easily migrate our infrastructure provider) we also could have a template for test scenarios. So for any reason any test management dies, we can use any other test management on the market.
